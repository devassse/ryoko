# Code Challenge,
from Vodacom M-pesa Software Developer role.
(3 days due date, having 2 days from now - 02/08/2023 - 04/08/2023)

# Steps:
Started reading carrefully the project requirements - A Travel Assistence App.
A Web based application. And, logically - responsive in order to fit on Mobile devices or even Deployed too (PWA, SPA).

Then, searched for some references and inspiraction for a UX/UI on the web.
Searched for some Logos (could design one, but there is no time).
The one I found, has some "Rights Reserved", but for Demo purpose, think will be fine.

Created Repository (Git Repo - public), named: "ryoko" - It is a Japanese expression for "Travel"
Repo URL: https://github.com/devassse/ryoko

Chosen Tech Stack (amoung some sugested)
- Javascript
 * React - for frontEnd.
 * NodeJs (Express) - for backEnd
And for Database (there was no sugestion), used mySQL.

("Wanted to use mongoDB, just for Javascript encosystem, but, there is no time for that.")

Then, 
Started the project, beginning with frontEnd,
And after that, built backEnd.

Connected them and implemeted Authentication, using JWT.
